# haystack
Searchable collections of items (haystacks) with a common interface


## RoadMap

1. Radix Tree and Generalized Suffix Array implementations
2. Port BEETL over to Rust as a collection type
3. Interval Tree and "colocator"-style search
4. SAIS or other index  construction improvements
5. Iterators and adapters for various file types
6. Demo wrapping with web service
7. Chimeric Search rewrite
8. Annotator re-write
9. Alignment implementations
